# How to run this website locally

Choose one of these options:

## Option 1: Open the file directly (quickest)
Double-click **html/index.html** in File Explorer, or right-click it → **Open with** → your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).  
The page will open at something like `file:///C:/Users/ACER/login,signup/html/index.html`.

## Option 2: Use Python (if installed)
Open a terminal in this folder and run:
```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```
Then open in your browser: **http://localhost:8080**

## Option 3: Use Node.js (if installed)
Open a terminal in this folder and run:
```bash
npx serve -p 8080
```
Then open in your browser: **http://localhost:8080**

## Option 4: VS Code / Cursor Live Server
If you have the **Live Server** extension installed, right-click **html/index.html** in the editor and choose **Open with Live Server**. It will open in your browser and auto-refresh when you save.

## Supabase setup for reporting flow

This project now includes:
- `report.html`: customer report form (with optional GPS capture)
- `dashboard.html`: admin map that reads reports from Supabase and shows markers

The browser uses `supabase-config.js` (anon key) to call the REST API.

### 1. Create table
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
create table if not exists public.reports (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  full_name text not null,
  contact text not null,
  location_text text not null,
  issue_type text not null,
  description text not null,
  latitude double precision,
  longitude double precision,
  source text default 'messenger_form',
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);
```

### 2. Enable RLS + policies (anon insert + read)
```sql
alter table public.reports enable row level security;

create policy "anon can insert reports"
on public.reports
for insert
to anon
with check (true);

create policy "anon can read reports"
on public.reports
for select
to anon
using (true);
```

### 3. Messenger flow wiring
- Messenger trigger and auto-reply are handled by your Facebook Page setup.
- Auto-reply should include your deployed `report.html` URL.
- Submitted reports are saved to Supabase and appear as markers in `dashboard.html`.
